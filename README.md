# OldPortfolio
An online portfolio with some past projects

This website was created to be an online portfolio for one of my classes in 2021. The projects listed in this website are not being updated. The arcade cabinet has since been finished. It uses a raspberry pi running retropie, which can be found here- https://github.com/rmpfeifer?tab=repositories. The website was made from scratch without using frameworks like bootstrap. Google fonts was also used for most of the text in the website. https://fonts.google.com/. 

An improvement I could make is to change the links in the website from google drive downloads to github links.
