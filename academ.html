            For my web development class, our final project was simply to make a website. I chose to make a new website for my now disbanded gaming clan Fused Legions. Our old one was able to direct people to our discord and steam group, but nothing else. It looked bad, and was in desperate need of a refresh. My website took inspiration from other squad clans while still retaining its true purpose- Directing people to our discord. Due to the clan being disbanded the website was never published, but you can download its file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1agxG3GqMaJnSAIcLyjDAWLgXG7jdCKOb/view?usp=sharing" style="color: rgb(99, 187, 175);">here.</a>

            For my introduction to database systems class, our final project was creating a database using SQL server for a fictional flight school, Derp University. We had to create a database capable of storing information relating to a student and their instructors, their courses, and all their diffrent certifications required to fly. You can download the backup file to restore he database <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pkiOuVIznZNFwZFctoAcOZs3LOK_Onkq/view?usp=sharing" style="color: rgb(99, 187, 175);">here.</a>
