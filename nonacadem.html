          <p>
            I am an eagle scout. I started scouting in 5th grade, and stayed in it while other boys in my class dropped out. I sucessfully reached the rank of Eagle, and am proud of my progress.

            Eagle Project
          </h2>
          <p>
            In order to become an eagle scout, you need to complete an eagle project that benefits anyone but yourself. I chose to goto a daycare near my house, The Holy Trinity daycare, and build them a playground slide. It used two tonnes of dirt, and took 2 days to build with a full crew of boys helping. The end result is a beautiful slide that the grounds crew there are eaisly able to maintain.

            Arcade Cabinet
          </h2>
          <p>
            Near the end of 2020, I decided to build a fully functional arcade cabinet using a raspberry pi and old electronics junk I would get from garage sales in my neighborhood. I set up RetroPi and MAME to run several old games, ranging from actual arcade games to N64 and Wii games. I got a kit of some beautiful chome buttons and drilled them into an old chunk of wood to use as a placeholder. Unfourtinatly, due to the skyrocketing price of lumber because of Covid, I was never able to purchase the wood to actually finish the cabinet. As a result, the whole thing has been banished to the storage closet, never to see real use until lumber prices fall.
